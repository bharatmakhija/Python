#Even better way to achieve the same result is using a class that implements iterator protocol.
# read iterators readme.md to understand better

# Basically when we try to run over a iterator ,__iter__ method is called.

# So what ever we send list, array etc are all containers which python knows how to traverse.
# what we did above is defined one of our own container and used __iter method to tell it to yield results one after another.
# In this case at the time of sum __iter__ method will be called at it will yield line by line, and sum method will keep using it and doing sum.
# once its yielded it will be consumed then only next yield will happen.
# next while accessing each number in for loop, again second item iter method will get called and all are yielded again , and for loop will keep using that yielded value one by one.
# to generate results. Remeber this yielding and consumption are sequential.

# However we need to make sure that only the container type is passed to normalize function, because normalize will work fine
# with containers implementing iterator protocol. But it should throw error if the input is iterable but not a container type.

# how do we check in input to a function is iterable and container type.

# Iterator protocol states that when a iterator is passed to a built-in iter function, it returns the same iterator itself.
# however when a container type is passed to iter function, a newly created iterator will be returned each time.
