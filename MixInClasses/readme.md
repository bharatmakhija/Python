# MixIn Classes

- mixins are small classes that only define a set of additional methods. 
- these classes don't define their instance attributes i.e. no attributes starting with self.something.
- These Don't require their constructors to be called. 

These classes can be best used for writing generic functionality.
Also using multiple-inheritance with these is a good idea to avoid repetative code. Infact take it as a rule
